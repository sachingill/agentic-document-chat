{"text":"TITLE: SIM Provisioning (Telecom) — Definition, States, and Retry Policy\n\nSUMMARY (1–2 lines)\nSIM provisioning activates and configures a SIM/eSIM profile on a mobile network. Provisioning flows must be resilient to transient carrier and backend failures.\n\nKEY TERMS\n- ICCID: physical SIM identifier\n- EID: eSIM identifier\n- MSISDN: phone number\n- IMSI: subscriber identity\n\nPROCESS OVERVIEW\n1) Validate input (ICCID/EID, customer, plan, compliance)\n2) Reserve network resources\n3) Activate SIM profile\n4) Confirm activation (carrier callback or polling)\n5) Persist state and emit events\n\nRETRY + BACKOFF (recommended)\n- Use exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures (timeouts, 5xx)\n- Cap retries (e.g., 6 attempts) and cap max delay (e.g., 5 minutes)\n- Do NOT retry on validation errors (4xx), missing identifiers, or policy blocks\n\nFAILURE MODES\n- Carrier API timeout\n- Downstream auth/token failure\n- Inconsistent state between billing and provisioning\n\nOPERATOR NOTES\n- Always record correlation_id, request_id, and carrier_transaction_id\n- Emit events: provisioning_requested, provisioning_activated, provisioning_failed\n","metadata":{"domain":"telecom_systems","topic":"sim_provisioning","source":"curated","doc_id":"telecom_001","title":"SIM Provisioning Overview","type":"runbook","version":"2025-12-14"}}

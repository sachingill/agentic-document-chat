{"id":"telecom_sim_provisioning","workflow":"multiagent","pattern":"auto","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"What is SIM provisioning?","expected_answer":"SIM provisioning is the process of activating and configuring a SIM/eSIM profile on a mobile network, including validation, resource reservation, activation/confirmation, state persistence, and retry handling for transient failures."}
{"id":"systems_circuit_breaker","workflow":"structured","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"Explain circuit breaker states and transitions.","expected_answer":"A circuit breaker typically has closed, open, and half-open states. It opens when error rate/latency thresholds are exceeded, stays open for a cooldown, transitions to half-open to probe recovery, then closes on success or re-opens on failure."}
{"id":"systems_circuit_breaker_agentic","workflow":"agentic","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"Explain circuit breaker states and transitions.","expected_answer":"A circuit breaker has closed/open/half-open states. It trips to open on sustained failures, probes in half-open after cooldown, then closes if probes succeed or reopens if they fail."}
{"id":"supply_chain_rop","workflow":"structured","inference_mode":"low","question":"What is reorder point (ROP)?","expected_answer":"Reorder point is the inventory level that triggers replenishment. It is commonly computed as demand during lead time plus safety stock."}
{"id":"pm_raid","workflow":"agentic","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"What is a RAID log in project management?","expected_answer":"A RAID log tracks Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies; it records owners, due dates, status, and mitigations to manage project delivery."}
{"id":"telecom_kpi_sla_slo","workflow":"multiagent","pattern":"sequential","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"What is the difference between SLA, SLO, and SLI?","expected_answer":"SLI is a measured service indicator (e.g., latency). SLO is the target for an SLI (e.g., 99.9% requests < 300ms). SLA is a contractual commitment that may include penalties if SLOs are not met."}
{"id":"systems_rate_limiting","workflow":"structured","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"What is API rate limiting and why is it used?","expected_answer":"Rate limiting restricts request rates to protect services from abuse and overload and to ensure fair use; common approaches include token bucket and leaky bucket."}
{"id":"supply_chain_safety_stock","workflow":"multiagent","pattern":"auto","inference_mode":"balanced","question":"What is safety stock and why do we keep it?","expected_answer":"Safety stock is extra inventory held to buffer against demand and lead-time uncertainty, improving service level and reducing stockouts."}

# Blind 75 (Python) — Problem Set Index + Tracker

This folder is a **study tracker** for the “Blind 75” interview problem set.

Rules (for learning):
- **No solutions are provided here** — you implement in your own files and we review.
- Solve 1 problem at a time; paste your attempt for feedback.

## How to use

1. Pick the next unchecked problem in `TRACKER.md`
2. Create a scratch file anywhere under `python_expert_learning/` (example: `python_expert_learning/problems/solutions/blind75/01_two_sum.py`)
3. Implement + run tests

## Files

- `TRACKER.md`: checklist of all 75 problems (by category)
- `TEMPLATE.py`: optional starting template for each problem file

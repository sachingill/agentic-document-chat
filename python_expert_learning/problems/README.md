# 🎯 Problem Solving Guide - FAANG Level

## 📚 Problem-Solving Structure

### Daily Routine
1. **Warm-up** (15 min): 1 Easy problem
2. **Main Practice** (45 min): 2 Medium/Hard problems
3. **Review** (30 min): Optimize solutions, learn patterns

### Weekly Goals
- **Week 1**: 20+ problems (Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Two Pointers)
- **Week 2**: 20+ problems (Trees, Graphs, DP, Backtracking)
- **Week 3**: 15+ problems (Hard) + System design problems
- **Week 4**: 20+ problems (Mixed) + Mock interviews
- **Total**: 75+ problems with optimal solutions

## 🎓 Problem-Solving Patterns

### 1. Two Pointers
- Use when: Array is sorted, need to find pairs
- Template: Left and right pointers moving towards center

### 2. Sliding Window
- Use when: Subarray/substring problems
- Template: Expand window, shrink when condition met

### 3. Hash Map
- Use when: Need O(1) lookups
- Template: Store seen values, check for complements

### 4. DFS/BFS
- Use when: Tree/Graph traversal
- Template: Recursive DFS or Queue-based BFS

### 5. Dynamic Programming
- Use when: Overlapping subproblems
- Template: Memoization or tabulation

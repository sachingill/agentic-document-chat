## 🎯 What You Need: FAANG-Level AI Engineering

You want:
- ❌ **NO basic datatypes** (strings, lists, dicts basics)
- ✅ **Competitive, FAANG-style** learning
- ✅ **AI Engineering level** (production ML systems)
- ✅ **Advanced topics** relevant to top tech companies
- ✅ **Real-world AI/ML engineering** challenges

---

## 🚀 Revised Focus: AI Engineering at FAANG Level

### Key Areas for AI Engineering:
1. **Performance & Optimization** (critical for ML systems)
2. **Concurrency & Parallelism** (model serving, data processing)
3. **Memory Management** (large datasets, model inference)
4. **Advanced Python Internals** (CPython, GIL, optimization)
5. **Production Systems** (scalability, reliability, monitoring)
6. **ML/AI Specific Patterns** (model pipelines, feature engineering)
7. **System Design** (distributed systems, microservices)
8. **Testing & Quality** (ML model testing, A/B testing)

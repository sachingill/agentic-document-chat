## 🎯 Revised Focus: FAANG-Level AI Engineering + Problem Solving

### What We're Building
**Competitive, production-grade Python skills for AI/ML engineering + Strong problem-solving abilities for FAANG interviews**

### Key Focus Areas:
1. **Performance & Memory Optimization** (Week 1) + **Problem Solving Foundations**
2. **Concurrency & Distributed Systems** (Week 2) + **Advanced Algorithms**
3. **Production AI Systems** (Week 3) + **System Design Problems**
4. **System Design & Architecture** (Week 4) + **Interview Preparation**

### Problem-Solving Goals:
- **Week 1**: 20+ problems (Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Two Pointers)
- **Week 2**: 20+ problems (Trees, Graphs, DP, Backtracking)
- **Week 3**: 15+ problems (Hard) + System design problems
- **Week 4**: 20+ problems (Mixed) + Mock interviews
- **Week 5**: 40-50 problems (Comprehensive practice test)
- **Total**: 115-125+ problems with optimal solutions

### What We Skip:
- ❌ Basic Python syntax
- ❌ Basic data types
- ❌ Beginner OOP
- ❌ Simple examples

### What We Focus On:
- ✅ Production optimization
- ✅ Scalable system design
- ✅ Real-world AI engineering
- ✅ FAANG-level challenges
- ✅ **Competitive problem-solving**
- ✅ **Algorithmic thinking**
- ✅ **Interview preparation**

## ✅ Week 5 Added: MIT-Style Problem Sets

### New Addition
- **Week 5**: MIT-level problem sets focusing on **Reasoning, Clarity, Creativity**
- **Reasoning Problems**: 10-12 problems (deep logical thinking)
- **Clarity Problems**: 10-12 problems (clear explanations)
- **Creativity Problems**: 10-12 problems (creative solutions)
- **Integration Problems**: 8-10 problems (combining all three)
- **Total**: 38-46 MIT-style problems

### MIT Problem Set Philosophy
- **Reasoning**: Deep logical thinking, understanding "why" not just "how"
- **Clarity**: Clear explanations, well-structured solutions, readable code
- **Creativity**: Creative approaches, thinking outside the box, elegant solutions

### Structure Created
- `week5/reasoning/` - Algorithm correctness, complexity analysis, design decisions
- `week5/clarity/` - Code refactoring, documentation, code review
- `week5/creativity/` - Multiple solutions, elegant approaches, creative thinking
- `week5/integration/` - Complex problems combining all three aspects
- Assessment tools for reasoning, clarity, and creativity

# Reasoning Problems - MIT-Style Problem Set

## 🧠 Focus: Deep Logical Thinking

## 🎯 What is Reasoning?

Reasoning in problem-solving means:
- **Understanding "why"** not just "how"
- **Proving correctness** of your approach
- **Analyzing trade-offs** between solutions
- **Identifying edge cases** and handling them
- **Explaining your thinking** clearly

## 📋 Problem Types

### 1. Algorithm Correctness Proofs
**Goal**: Prove why your algorithm works

**Example Problem:**
- Implement binary search and prove it's correct
- Explain the invariant
- Prove termination
- Analyze why it finds the correct answer

**Requirements:**
- Mathematical proof or logical reasoning
- Identify loop invariants
- Prove termination
- Prove correctness

### 2. Complexity Analysis with Reasoning
**Goal**: Prove time/space complexity

**Example Problem:**
- Analyze complexity of your solution
- Prove why it's O(n log n) not O(n²)
- Compare different approaches
- Explain best/worst/average cases

**Requirements:**
- Mathematical analysis
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Comparison with alternatives
- Edge case analysis

### 3. Design Decision Reasoning
**Goal**: Explain why you chose an approach

**Example Problem:**
- Why use a hash map vs. array?
- Why choose this data structure?
- What are the trade-offs?
- When would you use alternatives?

**Requirements:**
- Clear reasoning
- Trade-off analysis
- Alternative consideration
- Context-dependent decisions

### 4. Edge Case Reasoning
**Goal**: Identify and handle all edge cases

**Example Problem:**
- List all edge cases
- Explain how solution handles them
- Test edge cases
- Prove robustness

**Requirements:**
- Complete edge case identification
- Handling explanation
- Test cases
- Robustness proof

## 📝 Problem Format

Each reasoning problem requires:

1. **Solution**: Working code
2. **Reasoning**: Why it works
3. **Proof**: Correctness proof (if applicable)
4. **Analysis**: Complexity analysis
5. **Edge Cases**: Identification and handling
6. **Trade-offs**: Comparison with alternatives

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Can explain why algorithms work
- [ ] Can prove correctness
- [ ] Can analyze complexity
- [ ] Can identify edge cases
- [ ] Can explain trade-offs

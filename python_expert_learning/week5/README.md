# Week 5: MIT-Style Problem Sets - Reasoning, Clarity, Creativity

## 🎯 Week 5 Goals
MIT-level problem sets focusing on **Reasoning**, **Clarity**, and **Creativity** - not just solving problems, but thinking deeply, explaining clearly, and finding creative solutions.

## 🧠 MIT Problem Set Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Reasoning**: Deep logical thinking, understanding "why" not just "how"
2. **Clarity**: Clear explanations, well-structured solutions, readable code
3. **Creativity**: Creative approaches, thinking outside the box, elegant solutions

### What Makes MIT Problem Sets Different
- **Not just coding**: Requires deep understanding of concepts
- **Explanations matter**: Must explain reasoning clearly
- **Multiple solutions**: Encourages exploring different approaches
- **Elegant solutions**: Simplicity and beauty in code
- **Real-world thinking**: Connects to actual engineering problems

## 📚 Problem Set Structure

### Category 1: Reasoning Problems (10-12 problems)
**Focus**: Deep logical thinking and understanding

**Types:**
- Algorithm correctness proofs
- Complexity analysis with reasoning
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Why certain approaches work/don't work
- Edge case analysis and reasoning

**Example Topics:**
- Prove why an algorithm is correct
- Analyze trade-offs between approaches
- Explain design decisions
- Reason about edge cases
- Understand algorithm invariants

### Category 2: Clarity Problems (10-12 problems)
**Focus**: Clear explanations and well-structured code

**Types:**
- Code review and refactoring
- Documentation and comments
- Explaining complex algorithms
- Writing clear, readable code
- Teaching others through code

**Example Topics:**
- Refactor code for clarity

### Category 3: Creativity Problems (10-12 problems)
**Focus**: Creative and elegant solutions

**Types:**
- Multiple solution approaches
- Elegant one-liners (when appropriate)
- Creative data structure usage
- Novel algorithm combinations
- Thinking outside the box

**Example Topics:**
- Solve same problem 3 different ways
- Find elegant solutions
- Creative use of Python features
